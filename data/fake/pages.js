We aimed to provide students with the resources, opportunities and, experience necessary to be industry ready, all while still pursuing their degrees.</p><p style="text-align: center">Since then, the program grew to Indonesia and Africa. This year we are growing globally. From Asia to Africa; Europe, parts of the Middle East and North America- DSCs are training thousands of student developers and working with their communities to solve real-life problems. We are going to be in 700 universities across the globe by fall 2019!</p><p style="text-align: center">2019 is the first time Developer Student Club launching in Vietnam. Danang University of Science and Technology is proud to be one of the first 9 universities having a DSC recognized by Google Developer.</p>`
